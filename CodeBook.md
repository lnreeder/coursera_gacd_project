Merging test and training data
------------------------------
The assignment is not clear on how to merge the test and training 
dataset.  However, the particpant list for training is much larger 
than the participant list for test (@@Otherway), and is just numbers.  
As a result, joining the two datasets to create new columns 
didn't seem to be the right answer.  Instead, I merged the testing data
with the training data to create on data frame with a set of test rows
and a set of training rows.

The resulting dataset still has the same number and type of columns.

Choosing standard deviation and average columns 
-----------------------------------------------
Although the dataset had several sources of mean and deviation measurements,
I chose to use the "pure" mean and standard deviation variables, indicated
by the strings mean() and stdev() in the variable names.
