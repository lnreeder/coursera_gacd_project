The assignment is not clear on how to merge the test and training 
dataset.  However, the particpant list for training is much larger 
than the participant list for test (@@Otherway), and is just numbers,
.  As a result, joining the two datasets to create new columns 
didn't seem to be the right answer.  Instead, I merged the testing data
with the training data to create on data frame with a set of test rows
and a set of training rows.

The resulting dataset still has the same number and type of columns.
