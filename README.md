Course project for Coursera Getting and Cleaning Data
=====================================================


Dependencies
------------
The script does not download the data.  You should download it yourself and save it
into a file called 0Dataset.zip.  

The scripts use the plyr package for the "join" function, which provides easy dataset merging
without reordering rows.  Make sure you have plyr installed already if you don't have it 
by typing install.packages("plyr") in R.
